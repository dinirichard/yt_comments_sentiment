Below is a detailed development plan focusing on using large language models (LLMs) such as Ollama or Gemini to perform transcript summarization into topics and sentiment analysis of comments, all while handling YouTube data extraction.

---

## 1. **Requirements Analysis**

### **Functional Requirements**

- **Input:** A YouTube video URL.
- **Processing:**
    - Extract the transcript (closed captions or auto-generated using the YouTube Data API or external services).
    - Extract video comments (handling pagination and API limits).
    - Summarize the transcript into distinct topics using an LLM (e.g., Ollama, Gemini).
    - Map comments to these topics and use an LLM to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each topic.
- **Output:** A report or dashboard showing:
    - A list of topics derived from the transcript.
    - Sentiment scores or classifications for comments on each topic.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Scalability:** Efficiently process videos of varying lengths and rich comment sections.
- **Robustness:** Gracefully manage missing data (e.g., absent transcript or limited comments) and API rate limits.
- **Extensibility:** Modular components to allow switching LLM providers or adding language support.
- **Performance:** Asynchronous processing for time-intensive LLM calls and data extraction.

    - **Purpose:** Let users input the YouTube video URL and view the resulting topics and sentiments.
    - **Tech:** React, Vue, or Angular.

2. **Backend API / Orchestration Layer:**

    - **Purpose:** Serve as the core logic hub, receiving requests, coordinating data extraction, LLM processing, and returning results.
    - **Tech:** FastAPI or Flask in Python, or Node.js.

3. **Data Extraction Module:**

    - **Tasks:**
        - **Transcript Extraction:** Use YouTube APIs (or third-party libraries) to get the transcript.
        - **Comments Extraction:** Fetch comments with pagination management.
    - **Considerations:** Handle API rate limiting and cases with missing transcripts.

4. **Data Preprocessing Module:**

    - **Tasks:**
        - Clean and format the transcript and comments (e.g., remove HTML tags, normalize text).
        - Optionally aggregate comments if a video has thousands.

5. **LLM Processing Module:**

    - **Transcript Summarization & Topic Extraction:**
        - **Input:** Clean transcript text.
        - **Output:** A list of summarized topics.

## 3. **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Setup and Data Extraction**

1. **Tech Stack Selection:**

    - **Language & Framework:** Python with FastAPI/Flask.
    - **YouTube Data API:** Setup API keys and manage authentication.

2. **Transcript & Comments Extraction:**

    - Develop a module to:
        - Request captions (transcript) from the YouTube API.
        - Fetch comments, properly handling pagination and API error responses.
    - **Testing:** Create mocks for YouTube API responses.

3. **Infrastructure Setup:**
    - Initialize version control, set up Docker for containerization, and CI/CD pipelines.

---

### **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing**

1. **Cleaning & Normalization:**
    - Remove special characters, HTML tags, and irrelevant content.
    - Tokenize text if needed.
2. **Batch Processing:**
    - For large transcripts or many comments, set up batch processing to avoid hitting rate limits on the LLM.

---

### **Phase 3: LLM Integration (Topic Summarization & Sentiment Analysis)**

1. **Transcript Summarization to Topics:**

    - **Design:** Craft prompts for the target LLM (Ollama or Gemini) such as:
        > "Given the following transcript, extract and list the key topics discussed along with brief descriptions: [Transcipt Text]."
    - **Implementation:** Develop an interface that sends this prompt to the LLM API and receives the response.
    - **Validation:** Include guard clauses for very long transcripts; consider chunking the transcript if necessary.

2. **Sentiment Analysis per Topic:**

    - **Design:** For each topic, map related comments using keyword matching or embedding similarity.
    - **LLM Prompt:** For example,
        > "Analyze the sentiment of the following comments related to the topic '[Topic]'. Provide a sentiment score and classification (positive, negative, neutral): [Comments]."
    - **Error Handling:** Ensure the LLM response is parsed accurately (using regex or JSON formatting if possible).
    - **Aggregation:** Compute overall sentiment for each topic by aggregating individual comment scores.

3. **LLM API Wrapper:**
    - Encapsulate calls to Ollama/Gemini behind a common interface. This allows for easy swapping between LLM providers.
    - **Timeouts & Retry:** Implement strategies for API timeouts or failures.

---

### **Phase 4: Backend Integration & API Development**

1. **RESTful Endpoints:**
    - **Submit Video Endpoint:** Accepts a YouTube URL.
    - **Results Endpoint:** Returns topics and sentiments for consumption by the frontend.
2. **Asynchronous Processing:**
    - Because LLM calls might be time-intensive, use asynchronous processes (e.g., Python’s asyncio, Celery) to handle background jobs.
3. **Security & Rate Limiting:**
    - Ensure that endpoints validate input, handle errors gracefully, and throttle requests if necessary.

---

### **Phase 5: Persistence, Testing, and Deployment**

1. **Data Persistence & Caching:**

    - Use a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store processed results.
    - Use Redis or similar for caching to reduce repeated LLM calls on the same video.

2. **Testing:**

    - **Unit Tests:** For each module (extraction, preprocessing, LLM integration).
    - **Integration Tests:** End-to-end pipeline testing using sample videos.
    - **Performance Tests:** Especially for videos with extensive transcripts and comments.

3. **Deployment:**
    - **Containerization:** Use Docker to package each service.
    - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
    - **Monitoring:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools to keep an eye on API performance, error rates, and processing times.

---

## 4. **Additional Considerations & Future Enhancements**

- **Dynamic Prompt Engineering:**
    - Iterate on the LLM prompts based on user feedback and quality of outputs. Document prompt changes for future reference.
- **Scalability:**
    - Integrate queuing systems (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for managing asynchronous job queues as the system scales.
- **Multilingual Support:**
    - Incorporate language detection and support additional languages by adjusting prompts or using language-specific LLM models.
- **User Feedback Loop:**
    - Offer a mechanism for users to flag inaccuracies or provide feedback on topic extraction and sentiment analysis; incorporate this feedback into prompt refinements.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:**
    - Develop detailed front-end visualizations. Consider using frameworks like Dash or Streamlit to allow dynamic filtering and exploration of the results.
- **Fallback Methods:**
    - If LLM responses are delayed or fail, consider using a secondary algorithm for basic summarization or sentiment detection (e.g., rule-based or lexicon-based approaches like VADER).

This plan lays out a robust, modular approach that highlights LLM-based processing for both topic extraction and sentiment analysis. It anticipates challenges like rate limits and handling large amounts of text while providing an architecture that is scalable and maintainable.

If you’d like to deep dive into any specific module—such as prompt engineering with the LLM, asynchronous job orchestration, or advanced topic-to-comment mapping—let’s explore those details next.

# Comments

Below are the key elements from the YouTube comments data that are most useful for the project, along with an explanation of how each can be leveraged:

---

### **1. Comment Text**

- **Fields:**
    - **`textOriginal` / `textDisplay`**
- **Why It’s Useful:**
    - These fields contain the actual comment content. They are critical for any natural language processing task—whether you’re mapping the text to topics or using an LLM to gauge sentiment.
    - **Usage:** Send the raw comment text to your LLM (Ollama or Gemini) as input, making sure to instruct the model on how to extract sentiment, emotion, or any nuanced feedback related to a given topic.

---

### **2. Engagement Indicators**

- **Field:**
    - **`likeCount`**
- **Why It’s Useful:**
    - A higher like count often indicates that a comment resonates with the audience or is deemed influential.
    - **Usage:**
        - **Weighting:** When aggregating sentiment per topic, you can use the like count to weight the sentiment scores—ensuring that comments that are more popular have a larger influence on your final sentiment analysis.
        - **Filtering:** You may decide to give additional attention to highly liked comments to understand key drivers of sentiment.

---

### **3. Temporal Data**

- **Field:**
    - **`publishedAt`** (and **`updatedAt`**)
- **Why It’s Useful:**
    - Understanding when comments were made enables you to perform trend analysis.
    - **Usage:**
        - **Time-Based Filtering:** If the project evolves or if sentiment shifts over the life of the video, these timestamps allow for segmentation of the comments (e.g., early vs. late comments).
        - **Context:** They help provide a timeline perspective to the topics discussed in the transcript.

---

### **4. Comment Thread Context**

- **Fields:**
    - **`parentId`** (for replies)
    - **`topLevelComment`** in the `CommentThreadSnippet`
    - **`totalReplyCount`**
- **Why It’s Useful:**
    - **Parent/Reply Structure:** They allow you to differentiate between standalone comments and threaded replies.
    - **Usage:**
        - **Thread Aggregation:** For sentiment analysis, you might choose to aggregate the sentiment of a top-level comment with its replies—potentially revealing the evolution of a discussion thread.
        - **Contextual Relevance:** Understanding whether a comment is a direct response (reply) can help you maintain context when matching comments to topics.

---

### **Putting It All Together:**

For the project—where an LLM is used to both summarize transcript topics and perform sentiment analysis on comments—the following workflow can be established:

1. **Extract Comment Text:**
    - Use `textOriginal` or `textDisplay` as the primary input for sentiment analysis.
2. **Enhance Data with Engagement Metrics:**
    - Incorporate `likeCount` to weight sentiment, making sure that highly engaged comments amplify overall sentiment for a topic.
3. **Contextualize with Timing:**
    - Use `publishedAt` to understand sentiment trends over time or to perform temporal segmentation.
4. **Preserve Discussion Context:**
    - Recognize comment threads using `parentId` and `totalReplyCount`, so you can aggregate replies with their top-level comments when needed.

---

Each of these fields not only supports robust sentiment analysis when used individually but also complements the overall process of mapping user comments to the topics derived from the transcript. This integration is crucial when using LLMs for deeper context since you may also want to include meta-information (such as engagement or timeline data) in your prompts to the LLM, thereby enriching its understanding of the comment sentiment relative to the topics.

Would you like to explore specific strategies for integrating these fields into the LLM prompts or further details on scaling with asynchronous job processing and caching?
